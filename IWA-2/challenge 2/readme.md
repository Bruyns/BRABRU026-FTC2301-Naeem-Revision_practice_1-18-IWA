# IWA_2.5: Challenge 2
The following code should take the date variable and log it to the console. It is important that the code is commented on correctly. Please confirm that the correct tooltip is showing for the date value in VS Code as well.

 
``` js
/** (c) ACME Inc. 2010 */

/*
 * This is the date that a user created their account 
 */
const date = '10/07/2014'

console(date)
```

## what is wrong with the above code
* the multi-line comment on ln8-10 is missing a second astrix at the comments beginning
  ln13 is missing the log function causing it to not properly console.log the date
* the code is meant to console.log the date without it clashing with the comments above the const
