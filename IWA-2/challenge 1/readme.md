# IWA_2.4: Challenge 1
The following code is meant to log the following two variables to the console at the same time:

user
surname
At the moment nothing happens when the code runs. Please fix the issue, while keeping the comments associated with the variables.

 
``` js
/* This is the firstname of the user /*

const user = 'John'


    /* This is the lastname of the user /* const surname = 'Smith'


    console.log(user; surname;)
```

## what is wrong with the code ?
* the astrixs in the comments function are incorrectly placed and needs to be edited on ln10 and ln15
  the seperation in the console.log() consts are meant to be seperated by a , and not a ;
* the desired output is to console.log the user and the surname const
